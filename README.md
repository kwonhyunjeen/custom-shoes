# Custom Shoes - 3D Shoe Customization Web App

An interactive web application that allows users to customize 3D shoe models in real-time. Built with modern web technologies to provide high-quality 3D visualization and responsive user interface, inspired by services like Nike By You.

👉🏻 [Custom Shoes Project Dev Blog](https://kwonhyunjin.super.site/learnings)

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to create an intuitive shoe customization experience where users can:

- Rotate and view 3D shoe models in the browser
- Click on different parts to change colors
- Customize shoes according to their preferences
- Experience smooth, real-time 3D interactions

**Current Goal:** Building a foundation for 3D web development skills while creating an engaging user experience.

**Future Vision:** Implementing AI-powered natural language processing for commands like "Paint the laces with a summer vibe color!"
