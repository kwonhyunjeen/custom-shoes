## ✨ Features

**🎨 Interactive 3D Customization**

- Real-time 3D shoe model manipulation with smooth camera controls
- Click-to-select shoe parts with highlighting
- Comprehensive color palette with part-specific color rules
- Lighting and shadow effects for realistic visualization

**🤖 AI-Powered Natural Language Interface**

- Natural language color commands (e.g., "Make the laces look summery!")
- Powered by Cerebras LLM through Supabase Edge Functions
- Intelligent color interpretation and application
- Seamless integration with manual customization

**🎯 Advanced User Experience**

- Responsive design optimized for all devices
- Keyboard navigation support for accessibility
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Part-specific camera positioning for detailed viewing

## 🏗 Architecture

**Monorepo Structure**

- `/app` - React frontend application
- `/api` - Supabase Edge Functions for AI processing

**Tech Stack**

- **Frontend:** React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
- **3D Graphics:** Three.js + React Three Fiber + React Three Drei
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 with custom design system
- **AI Backend:** Supabase Edge Functions + Cerebras LLM
- **State Management:** React Context + Custom hooks
- **Development:** ESLint + Prettier + Lefthook

## 🚀 Getting Started

**Prerequisites**

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm 9+ (recommended)
- Supabase CLI (for AI features)

**Installation**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kwonhyunjeen/custom-shoes.git
cd custom-shoes

# Install root dependencies
pnpm install

# Install app dependencies
cd app && pnpm install

# Install API dependencies
cd ../api && pnpm install
```

**Development**

```bash
# Start the frontend (from /app directory)
cd app && pnpm run dev

# Start Supabase local development (from /api directory)
cd api && supabase start
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:5173

**Available Scripts**

**Frontend (app/)**

```bash
pnpm run dev          # Start development server
pnpm run build        # Build for production
pnpm run lint         # Run ESLint
pnpm run typecheck    # Type checking
```

**API (api/)**

```bash
supabase start        # Start local Supabase
supabase functions serve  # Serve edge functions locally
```
